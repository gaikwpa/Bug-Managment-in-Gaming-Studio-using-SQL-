# Bug-Managment-in-Gaming-Studio-using-SQL-
This is a small project about creating a bug management system in a gaming studio. I have demostrated the Current As-Is Swimlane process and modified To-Be process with changes.
Also, I have solved few business problems using our database managment system and Oracle SQL queries.
